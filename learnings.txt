was trying to display conflicts in the jquery template

$.template("defaultPlanTemplate", "Your plan:<br>                                       \
        <ul>                                                                            \
          {{each eventSlots}}   \
            {{if conflict}}                                                             \
              <li>${dtstart} - Damn! You have a conflict!!                              \
                <ul>                                                                    \

and it kept entering the if block, even though the eventSlots I  was passing in
didn't contain a "conflict" property.

after much cursing and debugging, I discovered that I had defined a conflict() function
as a test helper in my spec_helper.js , and this returned a truthy value. the template
was calling this! very frustrating! I have documented it in problems_spec.js

we tried to test our UI functions with jasmine fixtures and encountered
the following perplexities:
- see problems_spec

- browser differences 
	- fixtures not loading in chrome
	- safari sort array by dates thing not working

- bad debugging support in firefox

- lots of syntax errors not being highlighted to us
