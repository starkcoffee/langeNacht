we tried to test our UI functions with jasmine fixtures and encountered
the following perplexities:
- see problems_spec

- browser differences 
	- fixtures not loading in chrome
	- safari sort array by dates thing not working

- bad debugging support in firefox

- lots of syntax errors not being highlighted to us
